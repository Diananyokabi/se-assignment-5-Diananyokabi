9. Debugging in VS Code:
   - Outline the steps to set up and start debugging a simple program in VS Code. What are some key debugging features available in VS Code? 

   Debugging in VS Code
Visual Studio Code (VS Code) provides powerful debugging capabilities that help developers debug their code efficiently. Here’s how you can set up and start debugging a simple program in VS Code, along with key debugging features available:

Setting Up Debugging:
Install Required Extensions:

Ensure you have the necessary language extensions installed for your programming language (e.g., Python, JavaScript).
Go to the Extensions view (Ctrl + Shift + X or Cmd + Shift + X), search for your language extension, and install it.
Configure Launch Configuration:

Open your project folder in VS Code.
Click on the Debugging icon in the Activity Bar (or use Ctrl + Shift + D).
Click on the gear icon (Configure or Fix 'launch.json') and select your environment (e.g., Node.js, Python, etc.).
This action generates a launch.json file in the .vscode folder with default configurations for debugging.
Starting Debugging:
Set Breakpoints:

Open the file you want to debug in the editor.
Click in the gutter next to the line number where you want to set a breakpoint. A red dot appears, indicating the breakpoint.
Breakpoints pause the execution of your program at specific points to inspect variables and evaluate expressions.
Start Debugging Session:

Press F5 or click the green play button (Start Debugging) in the Debug view.
VS Code launches the debugging session based on your configured launch.json settings.
Control Debugging Session:

Use the Debug Sidebar to control the debugging session.
You can step through your code using F10 (Step Over), F11 (Step Into), and Shift + F11 (Step Out).
The Continue button (F5) resumes execution until the next breakpoint or the program's end.
Key Debugging Features in VS Code:
Watch and Variables Panel:

View and inspect the values of variables and expressions in real-time.
Add variables to the Watch panel to monitor their values throughout the debugging session.
Call Stack:

Track the call stack to see the chain of function calls that led to the current execution point.
Navigate through the call stack to understand how the program flow reached a particular point.
Debug Console:

Interact with your application during debugging through the Debug Console.
Execute commands and evaluate expressions in the context of the current debugging session.
Conditional Breakpoints:

Set breakpoints that trigger only when specified conditions are met (e.g., when a variable equals a specific value).
Exception Handling:

Configure VS Code to break on unhandled exceptions or specific types of exceptions.
Handle exceptions gracefully by inspecting the call stack and variables at the time of the exception.
Tips for Effective Debugging:
Explore Debugging Extensions: Look for extensions that enhance debugging capabilities for specific frameworks or languages.
Use Logging: Complement debugging with strategically placed logging statements to capture intermediate values and states.
Experiment with Hot Reload: Some languages and frameworks support hot reloading, allowing you to apply code changes without restarting the debugger.

10. Using Source Control:
    - How can users integrate Git with VS Code for version control? Describe the process of initializing a repository, making commits, and pushing changes to GitHub. 

    Using Source Control with Git in VS Code
Visual Studio Code (VS Code) provides seamless integration with Git, allowing developers to manage version control directly within the editor. Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to integrate Git with VS Code, initialize a repository, make commits, and push changes to GitHub:

Prerequisites:
Install Git:

Ensure Git is installed on your system. You can download it from git-scm.com.
Configure Git:

Set up your Git username and email using the following commands in the Git Bash or terminal:
bash
Copy code
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
Integrating Git with VS Code:
Open Your Project in VS Code:

Launch VS Code and open your project folder (File > Open Folder or Ctrl + K Ctrl + O).
Initialize a Git Repository:

Click on the Source Control icon in the Activity Bar on the left (or use Ctrl + Shift + G).
Click Initialize Repository.
VS Code prompts you to select the folder where you want to initialize the Git repository. Choose your project folder.
Stage and Commit Changes:

Make changes to your files in the editor.
Switch to the Source Control view (Ctrl + Shift + G) to see the changes.
Click on the + button next to each file you want to stage for commit or use Stage All Changes (the + in the blue circle).
Enter a commit message in the text box at the top of the Source Control view.
Press Ctrl + Enter or click the checkmark icon (✔) to commit the changes.
Push Changes to GitHub:

Ensure you have a GitHub repository created and its URL ready.
Click on the ellipsis (...) next to your last commit in the Source Control view.
Select Push from the dropdown menu.
VS Code prompts you to select the remote repository (GitHub).
Enter your GitHub repository URL (e.g., https://github.com/username/repository.git) and press Enter.
If you haven't authenticated with GitHub, VS Code will prompt you to sign in.
Manage Branches and Pull Requests (Optional):

Create and switch between branches using the Git: Create Branch and Checkout to... options in the status bar at the bottom of the window.
Pull changes from the remote repository using the Git: Pull command in the Source Control view.
Manage pull requests directly from VS Code if your GitHub repository is linked.
Additional Tips:
View Commit History: Use the ... button in the Source Control view to access commit history and compare changes.
Resolve Merge Conflicts: VS Code provides tools to resolve merge conflicts directly within the editor.
Explore Git Extensions: Install Git-related extensions from the Extensions view (Ctrl + Shift + X) to enhance Git functionality, such as GitLens for advanced Git features.
